| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| > 4 days              | 0%       | 100% of original price |
| 4 days                | 20%      | 80% of original price  |
| 3 days                | 40%      | 60% of original price  |
| 2 days                | 60%      | 40% of original price  |
| 1 day                 | 80%      | 20% of original price  |
| 0 days (today)        | 90%      | 10% of original price  |
| Expired               | -        | Not available for sale |

**Example:**
